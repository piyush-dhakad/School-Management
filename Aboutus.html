      <h5 style="text-align:justify; color:#656565; font-family: cursive;margin:2% 10%; line-height: 12px;">Parag Higher School Ujjain, the first of the missionary schools in Madhya pradesh is a  institution- under the article 30 of the Indian Constitution run by the Franciscan Madams (FSMA), a religious charitable order of nuns that saw the light of day on 3rd February 1896 with 57 students and 4 boarders in the present Parag Higher Secondry School campus. The school shifted to the present premises in 1913. 
          
          <br><br>Our school has enriched the minds of boys and girls alike till the late 1960’s where the boys used to study till grade II to be then transferred to Parag Higher School Ujjain. Sr. Baptista was the first Head Mistress. The French Madam had to face many difficulties – each day was a struggle. The inclement climate of the Desert State (then known as Rajputana under the British Rule), the language and customs were alien to them and caused their human bodies to succumb to illness and even death. But their spirit enriched by their love for and faith in the Holy Eucharist enabled the Sisters to forge ahead. The Sisters worked hard giving their all to their mission- that of spreading the light of knowledge especially to the girls of the Parsi families, the British Officers and Rajput families in the initial years.
<br><br>
The able Captains who steered this Marvellous Vessel of Knowledge over the years have been- Parag Higher School, the first Head Mistress (our School did not have Principals then.) Mother M.Theresa, Mother M.Damian, Sr. M. Frances, Sr. M.Stanislaus, Sr. M.Scholastica, Sr. M.Francine and at present Sr. M.Jyothsna.</h5><br>

      <h5 style="text-align:justify; color:#656565; font-family: cursive;margin:2% 7%; line-height: 12px;">Parag higher secondry school,Ujjain has successfully completed 40 years of its existence in Madhya pradesh. And, we are proud to say that over the years our School has prepared every student to succeed in life. They are motivated to work hard not only for themselves but for the greater good of our country and humanity. 
          Therefore,  They constantly strive to live up to the School Motto, ‘Let Your Light Shine’.  Our mission at S.M.A. is to ensure that every student grows up as a creative and responsible human being just as the Holy Bible says, ‘Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it’ (Proverbs 22:6).
<br><br>
                      We know that students today are caught up in a whirlpool of expectations and a race to perform better than their capabilities. Therefore, we believe that students need to relax at times and enjoy their studies for which we have a plethora of clubs, activities and events. At the same time, the value of rules and regulations to maintain discipline is also emphasized. We encourage our students to learn from the ‘Book of Life’ through sharing experiences, promoting interactions, facilitating communication and nurturing relationships with other fellow beings and the environment around.
<br><br>
Our school is an open platform that encourages the students to develop a creative and analytical mind to face the challenges of life independently and confidently. We strongly believe that our students are the promising future generation of a greater and better India. Therefore, we as their parents and educators share a great responsibility to shape them into better human beings who can and will ‘make a difference’ wherever they go. Let us remember that-</h5><br>

        <p style="font-family:cursive; text-align:justify; font-size:12px;">Science labs can be among the richest experiences students have at school. It is one of the few opportunities students will have to practice science much in the way professionals do. Often, though, labs are presented as mere recipes in which students follow precise instructions to arrive at a conclusion whose importance is not clear.  And our extremely efficient Science Department makes every possible effort to achieve this very purpose.</p>

      <h5 style="text-align:justify; color:#656565; font-family: cursive;margin:2% 7%; line-height: 12px;">Parag higher secondry school,Ujjain has successfully completed 40 years of its existence in Madhya pradesh. And, we are proud to say that over the years our School has prepared every student to succeed in life. They are motivated to work hard not only for themselves but for the greater good of our country and humanity. 
          Therefore,  They constantly strive to live up to the School Motto, ‘Let Your Light Shine’.  Our mission at S.M.A. is to ensure that every student grows up as a creative and responsible human being just as the Holy Bible says, ‘Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it’ (Proverbs 22:6).
<br><br>
                      We know that students today are caught up in a whirlpool of expectations and a race to perform better than their capabilities. Therefore, we believe that students need to relax at times and enjoy their studies for which we have a plethora of clubs, activities and events. At the same time, the value of rules and regulations to maintain discipline is also emphasized. We encourage our students to learn from the ‘Book of Life’ through sharing experiences, promoting interactions, facilitating communication and nurturing relationships with other fellow beings and the environment around.
<br><br>
Our school is an open platform that encourages the students to develop a creative and analytical mind to face the challenges of life independently and confidently. We strongly believe that our students are the promising future generation of a greater and better India. Therefore, we as their parents and educators share a great responsibility to shape them into better human beings who can and will ‘make a difference’ wherever they go. Let us remember that-</h5><br>
